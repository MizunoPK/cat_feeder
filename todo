- Treat avgs as color thresholds
    - Bento gets an upper threshold where anything below it is him
    - Nori gets a lower threshold where anything above it is her
    - Anything in between is then judge by how close it is to the thresholds
- Track a cat's center position during & after detection
    - If there's only 1 cat being seen, then you can skip color detection as you are tracking
    - If there is 2, then use color detection to determine position
    - if the cat is on the wrong side for too long, close that side's box
    - If a cat is already identified and a new cat appears, assume it is the other cat and immidiately ID
